            <h1>The Layout</h1>

            <p>
                For this task we had to make four different layouts with almost identical html page. In other words: use four different css files and one html page. I chose four different layouts which are: alternating, asymmetrical, hero and split.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the live demo <a href="/Ass/layouts/hero.html" target="_blank">here</a>
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>how did I make it?</h3>
                <p>
                    I started out with the hero page since that was the easiest one. With the knowledge I gained after the classmates task, I was able to divide the layout easier than I did before(with the div hell). Then I started out with the CSS: starting with the top to the bottom, header to footer. I also tried to use not much classes as possible in order to lessen the typework and make me better understand how the effects work with the css. Sometimes the css glitches when I use a class but then it works if I donâ€™t use one. I want to find out where it goes wrong and how I can solve the problem. That is why I have to use less class as possible to understand it better.
                </p>
                <img src="/img/lay1.png">
                <p>
                    With this mindset I did the other three layouts as well. The only real new thing I learned while making this task was making use of the transform:translate() inside the css. It was not something that crossed my path before and it definitely was useful for the split layout.
