            <p>The reason why I put the tag "FrontEnd" in this page, is because I also will reflect on my personal skills.
                You can directly go to <a href="#skills">there</a> if you dont want to read the reflection about working as a group and personal reflection.

            <p>
                For this semester I had two personal goals: taking more initiative and stating more opinions about the group work. These goals are basically from the previous semester, however I wont go too deep since this is only a reflection and not a PDR. I also will reflect myself on how I worked in the group and what can do better.
            </p>

                        But I defintely had these goals in mind thoroghout the semester.

                                <h3>A quick recap</h3>
                                <p>Lets have a quick recap of the goals I had in the previous semester. The first semester was divided into two sections: first was the orientation phase and the second one was the advanced phase. I made my own personal goal in each phase. 
                                    I will go through them briefly.
                                </p><br>
                                <p>In the orientation phase I had multiple goals each week. Although I have kept one personal goal and multiple study goals. My most important personal goal was making a proper study plan. And my important goal was improving on python. at the end of the orientation phase I made a self reflection and reflected on how I tried to improve it and if it indeed worked our or not. Long story short: making a proper study plan was yet to achieve since some of the classes were online and had yet to see improvements. 
                                </p>
                   
                                <br><p>Although with the other goal, Python, I improved. I was able to use Flask for my project properly and didn’t need much online help/guide as much as I needed to. 
                                    These goals were presented in a Word file.</p><br>
                                <p>In the advanced phase I still had the same goal in mind: making a proper study plan. And there was another goal I had which was being communicative. Those were the personal goals I had but I also made a study goal: learning JavaScript. Each week I wrote what I did in the project and portfolio and reflected myself. At the end of the phase/semester I wrote down my self reflection and presented the reflections in a website. I still have to improve on all 
                                    these three goals since I have yet to achieve the level I want to be.

                                <p>What are the personal goals I have for this semester? So far I will use the goals I had previous semester, which are:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Making a proper study plan</li>

                                <p>The goal this semester is to achieve at least proficient level.</p>

            <!-- goals -->
            <section>
                <h3>The goals</h3>
                    <h4>First goal</h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the semester I worked on these two goals by more talking and actually disagree whenever it didn’t fit my idea. Of course I also listened to the other group members and wasn’t stubborn unlike a certain someone in my group. I also came up with ideas such as dividing the interview into groups and the task divisions. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With that I can successful say that one of my personal goals is achieved. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>Second goal</h4>
                    <p>
                        The second goal I had was taking more initiative. At the beginning I didn’t take the lead or start a discussion however the group progress drastically went slower after the first submission due unknown reasons. I noticed this and started taking initiative by asking the group at the start of each meeting what had to be done, what is in progress and what the current process is. I did this for both the project and the UCD. I also made sure that everyone knew what the process is when one of the group member isn’t at school, by just sending a message in the group chat.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was hard for me to take initiative since I had to keep in mind that the given information actually will stick into the group members and not be discarded. Lucky enough the group members worked with the things I discussed and told them their opinion, this way I know I am not forcing my ideas and opinions into others. 
                    </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Group work reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to my personal goals, I stated my own opinion on each task/assignment/subject and had always an idea which differs from others. I listened to others and helped them out whenever they needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The communication also was good, even if English isn’t my first language. I made sure to discuss it step by step and asked if the others understood what I meant. Next was to make sure that the things I discussed was short and appliable. Due the slow progress after the first (or after half the second ) submission and the UCD assignment with the
                     <a href="/ucd/testing.html">“gathering feedback”</a>, 
                     we had short time. So it was important to make haste into making the assignments and the implantation so we had to divide the tasks individually. I made sure to finish my tasks on time and made room to help others if they needed help. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing was I am good at writing reports and very fast at that. For this semester and group this skill of mine came in handy since we had to write a report for the project, which follows the APA guidelines. However I thought everyone knew that writing a report as in APA guidelines, but that wasn’t the case, hence why my skill came in handy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However there are improvements that I can work on such as coming late to class. Since not everyone is living nearby they have to use the train and come earlier than the excepted time. That is why I have to come on time and not being late by 10 or 15 minutes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the last week of the semester I asked my group members what they noticed in my groupwork behavior and they all agreed on the fact that I finish my tasks, which are good and not sloppy, on time.

                <h3>Technical skills</h3>

                <p>
                    On the first semester I just got introduced into html, CSS and JavaScript. In my old portfolio, you can see how unstructured the layouts are, how basic the JavaScript animations are and how the images are not responsive. In this semester I definitely can say I improved into making a better structured  layout (mainly due frontend and UCD) and making the images responsive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With CSS I drastically improved. I now am able to use the keyframe animations and using CSS tricks. I also am able to combine the CSS with JavaScript, as you can see with the light/dark mode in this portfolio. By using the CSS root colors and JavaScript if/else statement I was able to make this. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The html knowledge is also improved. I now know more about the html tags and am able to make it to my use. As you saw in my project page, I combined the html element and JavaScript to make it more attractive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I definitely can say that my JavaScript is improved. First I made a research about JavaScript arguments, what they are and what they do. This combined with the FED class I can say for sure that my knowledge and insight is broader than it was before. Thanks to that I was able to make more research about my personal projects and am able to make at least intermediate challenges on JavaScript. 
                </p>
