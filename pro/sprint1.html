            <p>
                Before starting the group project, we set up our good and bad skills on a whiteboard. This way we can know what to expect from our group members. After that we divided the group roles, and I was an facilitator. In any case the group roles were not really important since till the end of the sprint we did nothing with them aside the group leader or the notetaker. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since we got to know our group members, we sat together and checked out how the semester will look like and what our expected deadlines will look like. Now that also was settled we started on working on our project plan. We discussed as a group what Fontys might expect from us and how our group will be called. Afterwards we divided the tasks to write down the project document, and I wrote down the project definition and scope & limitations. I also helped a bit out with the deliverables.

                <h3>The interviews</h3>
                <p>
                    Our ideas and projects were clear so we started out with the surveys and interviews. I helped out with thinking of survey and interview questions and afterwards I was the one who suggested to divide the interviews into a group of two. When the division was decided we as group were thinking how to divide the semesters. We ended up with semester 1,2,3 and 7. Me, Iris and Agatha did semester 2 and 7 and the other three did the other semesters.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to arrange a appointment with semester 7 students since they were in another building of Fontys, in Strijp. so I asked the teacher through Teams if it was possible to interview some of her students. she replied however she never really came back so we had to go to her.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The same day we went to the other building. In total we interviewed three students, and each one of us asked the questions to the interviewee.  I also observed the users and wrote down notes for the empathy map. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fun thing I did when I was the interviewer, I asked the questions which wasn’t on the note our group has prepared but instead was asking questions which fitted the situation at that moment. For example: the interviewee was talking about his internship and I asked some in depth questions. Or before my group member started interviewing, I saw that the interviewee was nervous so I calmed her down by telling her that it will be a short interview and just made a short conversation. When the interview was finished we asked everyone inside the open space to make the survey through a QR-code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the interviews each one of us made their own interviewed transcript with the summary and an empathy map. Afterwards our whole group sat together and made personas separately. I also made the survey analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When that was finished I made the user requirements based on the research we did. We also had to write down our mission statement etc for UCD, which was connected to our group project, which I wrote down and discussed with the group afterwards.

                <h3>Second submission/sprint</h3>
                <p>
                    After the first submission we continued researching and making our prototype with Figma. We didn’t do much separately since it was the design phase. Aside from designing we also had to start making a report. Lucky for me the report has to be made as the APA rule, which I have enough knowledge on thanks to my highschool and my previous study. Since I had prior knowledge and prior experience I started with making the basic layout on the report. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the second submission I still worked on the structure of the report. The research we did before for the project plan were not yet added to the report, so I added it to the report. Then we got as feedback to have a research question with sub questions, so I thought of some based on the information we basically already acquired. Since the whole group agreed with the things I wrote down on the report I just continued to do so.
