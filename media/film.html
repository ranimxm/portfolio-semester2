            <p>For this task, I had to make a group and make a film. I made a group of five and our documentaire was about pets in the Netherlands.
                The <a href="" target="_blank">video</a> is saved inside the onedrive. If you want you can watch the it through the link.
            </p>

            <section>
                <h3>What are my contributions?</h3>
                <p>At first our group sat together and talked about the ideas and the goal of the film. We all agreed on talking about the pets inside the Netherlands. 
                    This is because making the videos and getting information are easier then thinking of a scene, since most of our groupmembers have pets. They know the pros and cons etc.
                </p>
                <p>Now that the subject is discussed, we now have to talk about how the scenes will play out. First we talked about how the video will play out and afterwards giving the 
                    statics and then the pros/cons. Before the end we interview some people about their experience with a pet and finish it with a conclusion.
                </p>
                <p>since the scenes are discussed we now come to the part where we divide the tasks. Those with pets will film their own pets and those who dont own a pet will give an interview and film the view/streets.
                    I don't own any pets so that means I had to interview and film a park. I also volunteerd to film a con about how expensive the pets can be.
                    The task division is divided fairly and is noted on paper. You can see the image below for the division.
                </p>
                <img src="/img/video1.jpeg" class="image">
                <p>For the wallet section, I used my own wallet and asked a groupmember to hold the camera to record me taking out my money out of my wallet.
                    Before putting the video inside DaVinci, I sped up the video by around 3 times. The reason why I sped it up in my editor and not inside davinci is because the frame per second will change from 24/s to 28/s. 
                    After that I recorded the clock for 5 minutes. I used a tool by the ISSD to let the camrea stand still on the table. I sped up the video the same way as the wallet part.
                    Now both the wallet and the clock are done, I put them together in one timeline inside DaVinci. I lowered the opacity of the clock. 
                </p>
                <p>The next section I did was the park. Lucky enough there were some dogs inside the park however I am terribly afraid of them so I kept my distance. I had to make sure to not move alot while showing the park. 
                    Lucky enough I had no need to edit this part out.
                </p>
                <p>Another section was the expensive prices. I wnet inside a grocery shop and filmed the food with their price tag. I had to edit some parts inside DaVinci, such as cutting the sudden movement while recording or the transitions between two scenes.

                </p>
                <p>The last part I edited and filmed was the interview of Iris. To edit an interview it was important to not cut out the "uuh" or "aah", which I did. </p>
