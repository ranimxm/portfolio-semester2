                    <h4>The Thing we had to add in our (the project group) projectplan:</h4>
                    <li>Making empathy map;</li>
                    <li>Team mission statement;</li>
                    <li>Project details;</li>
                    <li>User requirements;</li>
                    <li>functional requirements;</li>
                    <li>database/flow diagrams.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    We divided these points in our group: I made the project details. Each one of us had to make their own empathy map and as group we made the functional and user requirements. The project details was very similar what we had in our project details, so there was not much to do in that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, the empathy map is something I had to pay attention to since this was the first time working on it. The first thing I paid attention to was how the user (interviewee) was reacting towards the questions: were they thinking too deeply? Or was it just a fast reply to get it over with? And what was their expression? Happy? Or confused? Those small details always helps with getting to know your target audience.
