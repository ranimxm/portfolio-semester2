                    We had to make 4 different layouts with almost the same identical html. In other words: use 4 different CSS files and 1 html page. We had one week time to make it. 
                    I only made 2/1,5 layout when the week was finished so I couldn’t receive proper feedback. However the second time I got feedback and it was looking good. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To be honest, this is actually a good exercise to make pages. Since the html needs to be clear enough and somehow it motivated me to use the words parents and children in the css to code it faster. So I made a little challenge by myself to make a basic layout within 30 minutes: which I succeeded, however it wasn’t responsive. Ah well, it is a start.
