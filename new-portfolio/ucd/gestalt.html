            <h1>The Gestalt Principles </h1>
            <img src="/img/gestalt.jpg" class="image-content">
            <section>
                <h3>Research about the principles</h3>
                <ol>
                    <p>There are six gestalt principles in the UX:</p>
                    <li>Figure/Ground: 
                        We tend to perceive elements as either the foreground (figure) or the background (ground). This helps us distinguish objects from the environment around them;
                    </li>
                    <li>Similarity: 
                        Elements that are similar to each other are perceived as a group. This is because users tends to group things together that share similar characteristics, such as color, shape, or size;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity: Elements which are close to each other will be perceived as a group. This is because the humanmind tends to group things together that are close in a certain amount of space;
                    </li>
                    <li>Continuety:
                        The eye tends to follow lines or curves, which can cause elements to be perceived as a group. For example, if you see a series of dots arranged in a curved line, your eye will tend to follow the line and perceive the dots as a group, rather than as individual elements;
                    </li>
                    <li>Closure:
                        When elements are arranged in a way that suggests a complete form, even if it is not actually complete. We tends to fill in the missing pieces and perceive a complete whole. For example, if you see a circle with a small gap in it, your mind will tend to fill in the gap and perceive the circle as complete;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        symmetry and order:
                        The humanmind tends to perceive elements as organized and symmetrical. This is because symmetry and order are often associated with stability and predictability, which are important for our survival.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>With these in mind I had to use the group's fidelity and recreate it using the gestalt principles.</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>The recreation</h3>
                    <img src="/img/gestaltg.jpg">
                    <p>The left side is the fideltiy of our group and the right side is with the changes I made. </p>
                    
                    <p>The first change was to the section with the specializations. By changing the menu from a vertical orientation to a horizontal one,
                        I utilized the gestalt princple of contiuation. This principle states that the eye tends to follow lines or curves, which helps guide the users attention and creates a more 
                        visuallized experience. I also modified the arrows to point dirrections, to draw the user's attention to the important elements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second change was to the section with the examples. I used the principle of similarity to arrange the grey boxes and text symmetrically.
                        This princple states that elements that are similar to each other are perceived as a group and arranging elements symmetrically can create a sense of balance and organization.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third change was to the grey boxes in the examples. By giving the boxes different widths, I applied the principle of proximity. This principle states
                        that elements that are close to each other are perceived as a group, so seperating the grey boxes with different widths helps the user perceive them as individual elements
                        rather than a single group.
                    </p>
