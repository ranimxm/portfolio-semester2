                        <h4>Human interaction</h4>
                        <li>Uses colors very well: only limited to three colors (red, yellow and blue/purple) while maintaining a well composed layout. Also implementing the color theory(triadic colors);</li>
                        <li>
                            The website uses interactive elements, such as animations or moving images, to engage the user and make the website feel more interactive.                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Twitter</h4>
                         <li>Aside from being one of the most used social media, it has a very straight forward layout. If you log in through your computer you can see in the center your feed, ads and/or 
                            recommended users. On the right side you see tags, messages which you can hide and on the left side some settings and your profile. Pretty straightforward;</li>
                        <li>It is responsive, and it isn’t too difficult to understand</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Batenbouw</h4>
                        <li>The website uses a limited color palette effectively, without overwhelming the user with too many colors;</li>
                        <li>The menu isn’t confusing. Instead of putting the social media or the number in the footer, they put it on the top. I don’t see it that often but it definitely is much easier if you want to contact them immediately. </li>
                        <li>
                            The website has an attractive landing page, with visually appealing elements and a clear call to action;                  
                         </li>
                         <li>
                            The website is responsive and easy to use on different devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones.

                        <h4>Lipton Website</h4>
                        <li>
                            The website has low-quality images that may make the website look unprofessional and hinder the user experience.
                             You can see the white lines next to the image and even low resolution. This will make the website less professional and trustworthy.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The menu does not work properly. It wont close when the user tries to close it. This can make it difficult for the some people to navigate the website and find what they are looking for.                        
                        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <h4>Zara Shop</h4>
                        <li>The wording and placement is very confusing. What do they expect from an user? shopping? or checking out the models?</li>
                        <li>
                            The hero page or landing page for this website is confusing, as it is not clear what the goal of the page is. It is not clear which action the website wants us to take. This can be frustrating for us and may cause us to leave the website.
                        </li>    
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Cider Shop</h4>
                        <li>The font type is VERY annoying to read, and the font size is also VERY small. It is not very pleasant to read in each and every device, even on desktop. </li>
                        <li>
                            It uses a confusing clothing menu that is hard for me to navigate or find specific items. The website has a confusing menu structure, making it hard to understand where to find specific items or categories.                
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The website is not  responsive and does not work well on different devices.
