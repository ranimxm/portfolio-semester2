                <h3>The research</h3>
                <p>
                    We got an introduction into the heuristic evaluations and it was up to every group to make use of this evaluation for the project.
                    There are 10 heuristics which are a set of principles for evaluating the usability of a user interface made by Jakob Nielson.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    The 10 heuristics are:
                    <li>
                        1. Visbility of system status: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        2. Match betwee system and the real world: The system should speak the users language, concepts what are familiar to the user. 
                        Make information appear in a natural and logical order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        3. User control and freedom: Users often choose an element by mistake and want to undo that certain mistake or go back without having to go through an extended dialogue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        4. Consistency and standars: Ussers should not have to wonder wether different actions, situations or words mean the same thing. For example the close/bigger window is almost always on the right top, unless you have a macbook.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        5. Error prevention: A careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. Present the users with a confirmation option before they commit an action, is an example.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        6. Recognition rather than recall: Minimize the users's memory load by making elements and options visible. The user should not have to remember information, so the instructions for example should always be visible or easily retrievable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        7. Flexibility and efficiency of use: Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        8. Aesthetic and minimalistic desgn: Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes) what precisly indicate the problem and perhaps suggest a solution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        10. Help and documentation: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Such information should be easy to search and not be too large.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>The evaluations on our project</h3>
                <p>
                    After the short research is done, our group compared each principle into our prototype. We divided the risk into 2/3 each person and wrote down our own thoughts about it and then we all sat together to rate the 
                    severity of the principle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In class we provided with a template for the heuristic evaluation inside Figma which our group used.
                    On the images below you can see our evaluations and the severity.
                </p>
