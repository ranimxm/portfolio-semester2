            <h1>Gathering feedback</h1>
            <img src="/img/test.png" class="image-content">
            <p>
                For this task I had to perform with my project group and gather feedback about our prototype. We had to gather feedback through: a survey, interviews, AB testing and with those information we made storyboards and an user analysis. 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <p>
                    This time it was convenient to divide the task in the group in order to meet up with the deadline, since we also needed to start working on implementing the prototype. We divided the task as follow:
                </p>
                <li>
                    -	Me and Iris made the interview/survey questions and came up with the idea of combining  the methods of feedback gathering (thanks to another group);
                </li>
                <li>
                    -	Story boards were made by Thimo and Melita;
                </li>
                <li>
                    -	User analysis was depending on how the interview will go;
                </li>
                <li>
                    -	Interview is divided into two groups: Me, iris and Melita were doing two interviews; Thimo and Moussa will interview one teacher;
                </li>
                <li>
                    -	The prototype will be updated after the interviews are included.
                </li>
                <p>The things I didn’t make or not fully, will be added as a 
                    <a href="/files/Pitch-document.pdf" target="_blank">pdf file.</a>
                    It is the pitch document me, Iris, Thimo and Melita made.</p>

                    <p>There were some things that went wrong in the group communication, or teamwork which I want to point out. You can read it

                        I know it is the last week/deadline before submitting the assignment/portfolio however I do wish to point out some things about how the group work went the last few weeks before the vacation which gave me a huge ick. I didn’t wish to point this out since there are only a few weeks left but I do want to put it inside the portfolio just in case. The last few weeks before the holiday our group had a bit slow process than usual which I honestly don’t mind however once this UCD assignment came(not in a negative way, assignments are always welcome), we had to make deadlines inside the group in order to actually finish our submission. Sadly enough not everyone was on school or they didn’t want to discuss the group assignment due ‘not being the right day/schedule’ or they came too late too school. I don’t mind if someone is not showing up or any other things as long as the deadlines will be finished. Since the group leader nor some other group members didn’t lead, I thought it was for the best if I lead the project, which I did, partly. Once our group finally sat together in the afternoon, I discussed what had to be done and send the expected things which had to be finished BEFORE Friday, I even noted down the time we were expected to meet… 
                    </p>

                        Well the day came and not everyone was there at 10am nor 11am… Okay that can happen so me and Iris already started doing the interview since there was class in the afternoon + we discussed this already the other day. When preparing the interview the first thing I noticed is that the prototype was not finished nor fully clickable… got a bit irritated but fine that can happen. It was break time so I sat back with the group and the first thing I hear is Moussa being mad at me and iris for doing the interview. Well… no. I tried to explain that if you come not on time, not reading the message clearly or understanding the discussion completely that you expect to take it slowly? Sadly enough he still wanted to have his own way and I just brushed it off as a “miscommunication” since after all, we only have a few weeks as long as he does the coding im good. After break, me iris and Melita did another interview since it had to be finished before Friday. Moussa didn’t accept that. He brushed the feedback off as ‘unacceptable’ since the prototype was not finished at all. Too bad, then he had to finish it earlier but he didn’t understand that sadly enough. But either way we still ended up using this feedback because I clearly stated how tight we are with the deadline and somehow mid the discussion the prototype was finished. What a weird way. After that discussion he still tries to have his own way and if it doesn’t then he just gets annoyed and does a poor job.

                        Well, that was about it. I am sorry if the text is unrelated to the assignment itself, but since it is tagged as project I might as well add some groupwork inside it. In the next sections I will continue with the assignment. Thank you for the attention.

                <h3>Survey and ab testing</h3>
                <p>
                    We combined the interview and AB testing in order to save up some time and since it was convenient to do. This way it was easier to get multiple answers with simple questions in a short amount of time. We focused on comparing the Fontys website to our redesigned website, and made sure to avoid overly general or detailed questions to keep the users' attention. 
                </p>
                <img src="/img/test2.png">
                <p>
                    The first part of the survey focused on the Fontys website, with users being shown a picture of the page and asked to provide feedback on what they liked and didn't like about it. This allowed us to determine what features of the Fontys website are valuable to keep in mind for the redesigned version.
                </p>
                <img src="/img/test3.png">
                <p>
                    The second part of the survey focused on the redesigned website, including a comparison to the previous high fidelity version. Users were given the option to choose which version they preferred and explain their reasoning. This helped us understand how the redesign was received and where we could make improvements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The important thing we had to keep in mind that the flow was understandable for the user and not being complicated. Also that the information which was given will be useful for our project, and not only comparing the two websites. I wont go into detail about the results of this survey, however I can conclude that the current Fontys website has not enough information the courses.

                <h3>The interview</h3>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this interview was to observe users interacting with our prototype and gather feedback on the design and functionality of the page. Two researchers conducted the interview, with one asking questions and the other observing the user's interactions. A large screen connected to a laptop was used to track where the user navigated, experienced difficulties, and focused their attention. The goal was to gain insights into the user experience of our prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing we did was getting to know the user: who they was, how old and what they were studying. Afterwards we just ask them question and the other one observes. I was the observer for the two interview. The first thing I did was tracking how long the user stays still on a certain section by looking at their cursor. The next thing was how the looked at the webpage: frowned? Or neutral? Another thing I looked was how they answered the questions, did they answer it too quickly or too slow? With these data combined I was able to come up with a conclusion and a summary. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the interview me and Iris made the user task based on the interview and the story board: 
                </p>
                <img src="/img/test4.png">
                <p>
                    The first student we interviewed was a graduate media student who studies software at the moment. The second student was an international student who studies media. Based on the interview we thought of a task and the sub task they might have when visiting the website. We did the same thing for the second student.
