            <h1>UX and psychology </h1>
            <img src="/img/uxpsycho.png" class="image-content">
        
            <article>
                <p>
                    It may seem that the most basic UX commonplaces, like “make the main button big and bright” is something obvious. These things are not just an established way of designing similar websites: they are based on psychological principles.
                </p>
                <p>These psychological principles are divided by nine principles: </p>
                <ol>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Least Effort</h4>
                        <li>The principle of least effort has been used in other disciplines: psychology, sociology, economics, marketing, and information science;</li>
                        <li>This principle applies not only to people but also to animals and even machines;</li>
                        <li>
                            This principle is about designing the website in a way that requires the least amount of effort for users to access and use the website.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To make the website least effort for the users, designers/website can provide clear information, inituitive navigation and reduce the numbers of task to clear a task;
                        </li>
                        <li>Grammarly's demo is a good example of this principle because it shows users how the tool works, rather than just telling them through guidelines.
                        </li>
                        <img src="/img/grama.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Perpetual Habit</h4>
                        <li>The principle of perpetual habit is about designing the website in a way that is familiar and predictable to users;</li>
                        <li>Make use of the standard elements and layout patterns that are commonly used in other websites.</li>
                        <li>The use of a standard hamburger menu is a good example of this principle because it is a commonly used navigation element that users will be familiar with.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Socialization</h4>
                        <li>People want to be social, and they greatly rely on technology in order to achieve it. More than that, they use technology in order to feel accepted into society.</li>
                        <li>
                            So, this principal is about designing the website in a way that allows users to connect and interact with each other. 
                        </li>
                        <li>For example using the social media platforms to share, or engage with the content;</li>
                        <li> TikTok is a good example of this principle because it is a social media platform that allows users to share and engage with content, as well as communicate with each other.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Emotional Contagion</h4>
                        <li>Have you ever noticed that emotions are contagious? If a person you like is laughing out loud, you will be smiling.</li>
                        <li>We subconsciously take over the emotions and behaviors of other people, especially of those we like.</li>
                        <li>
                            The principle of emotional contagion is about designing the website in a way that evokes emotions in users.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make a wish website/campaign. They show with pictures and some touching words how these kids have wishes and dreams. It is supposedly to touch us and make us, as audience, feel emotion. </li>
                        <img src="/img/makeawish.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Identity</h4>
                        <li>All people need a sense of identity, a feeling of belonging, an understanding of who they are.
                            This is why people make friends, to feel associated with somebody. 
                           </li>
                           <li>
                            The principle of identity is about designing the website in a way that helps users feel a sense of belonging and connection to the brand.
                           </li>
                        <li>After each survey/feedback thanking the user: shows that it cares about user;</li>
                        <li>
                            TikTok's surveys are a good example of this principle because they show that the platform cares about its users and wants to understand their needs through asking feedbacks; 
                        </li>
                        <li>By providing these opportunities for interaction, TikTok is able to create a sense of connection and belonging among its users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Beauty</h4>
                        <li>People choose books by their cover. Given the opportunity to choose, people choose beautiful places to travel to, beautiful houses to live in, and nice clothes to wear.</li>
                        <li>In this principle its all about the design of the website that is pleasing to the user;</li>
                        <li>By using colors and layours it can be achieved;</li>
                        <li>Human interaction company: moving background. Also the colors matches with the color wheel so they look nice together.</li>
                        <img src="/img/humi.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two</h4>
                        <li>The term comes from a psychological article published by George A. Miller, the psychologist at Harvard University. 
                            According to this paper, a person can hold from five to nine things in their short-term memory.
                            </li>
                            <li>So basically this principal is about designing the website in a way that takes into account the limits of human short-term memory.</li>
                        <li>MediaMarkt's website is a good example of this principle because it has a large assortment of products, but organizes them in a way that is easy for users to navigate.
                             </li>
                        <img src="/img/mediamarkt.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Psychology of Mistakes</h4>
                        <li>All people make mistakes and it is defintely annoying
                            In terms of design: user testing to find out where they make a mistake;
                            </li>
                            <li>design the website in a way that allows users to easily correct mistakes;</li>
                        <li>Undo button is defintely important!! after all as users we want to fix our mistakes as fast as possible; </li>
                        <li>After paying with Klarna, you will receive both a message and an email with the content of the payment and order. So if there was made a mistake you can see it in the text which is handy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Focus, Attention and Concentration</h4>
                        <li>The attention span of an adult is from ten to twenty minutes. After this  people tend to lose focus and concentration and get distracted by anything near them</li>
                        <li>The websites need to make sure to grab the attention of the users and retain it as long as needed;</li>
                        <li>Shein has a lot of pop ups- defintely annoying if it didnt give coupons or discounts.</li>
                        <img src="/img/sheindiscount.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>

                </ol>
