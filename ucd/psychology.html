            <h1>UX and psychology </h1>
            <img src="/img/uxpsycho.png" class="image-content">
        
            <article>
                <p>
                    It may seem that the most basic UX commonplaces, like “make the main button big and bright” is something obvious. These things are not just an established way of designing similar websites: they are based on psychological principles.
                </p>
                <p>These psychological principles are divided by nine principles: </p>
                <ol>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Least Effort</h4>
                        <li>The principle of least effort has been used in other disciplines: psychology, sociology, economics, marketing, and information science;</li>
                        <li>This principle applies not only to people but also to animals and even machines;</li>
                        <li>People want information/content provided to them as quickly and simply as possible. thus this principle has becoma a guidline for ux designers;</li>
                        <li>Grammarly is one of the examples: explains it with a demo instead of guidelines.</li>
                        <img src="/img/grama.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Perpetual Habit</h4>
                        <li>The principle of perpetual habit states that people greatly rely on their memory and habit when doing this or that task;</li>
                        <li>Users want the things to be where they should be;
                            </li>
                        <li>Think about easy navigationbar and a one click to homepage in every page
                            For example the hamburger menu: always three lines.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Socialization</h4>
                        <li>People want to be social, and they greatly rely on technology in order to achieve it. More than that, they use technology in order to feel accepted into society.</li>
                        <li>For example using the social media platforms to share, or engage with the content;</li>
                        <li>Tiktok is made recently and it already became one of the biggest company due to social media; short duration on videos, brings back the musically vibes and you are able to share it with any other platform as well. Communicating with others is also very easy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Emotional Contagion</h4>
                        <li>Have you ever noticed that emotions are contagious? If a person you like is laughing out loud, you will be smiling.</li>
                        <li>We subconsciously take over the emotions and behaviors of other people, especially of those we like.</li>
                        <li>Make a wish website/campaign. They show with pictures and some touching words how these kids have wishes and dreams. It is supposedly to touch us and make us, as audience, feel emotion. </li>
                        <img src="/img/makeawish.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Identity</h4>
                        <li>All people need a sense of identity, a feeling of belonging, an understanding of who they are.
                            This is why people make friends, to feel associated with somebody. 
                           </li>
                        <li>After each survey/feedback thanking the user: shows that it cares about user;</li>
                        <li>Tiktok with every report or once in a every while, you can see on your screen a survey which we as users can fill in. this shows that they do care about us.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Principle of Beauty</h4>
                        <li>People choose books by their cover. Given the opportunity to choose, people choose beautiful places to travel to, beautiful houses to live in, and nice clothes to wear.</li>
                        <li>In the psychology of web design, beauty is all about User Interface.</li>
                        <li>Human interaction company: moving background. Also the colors matches with the color wheel so they look nice together.</li>
                        <img src="/img/humi.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two</h4>
                        <li>The term comes from a psychological article published by George A. Miller, the psychologist at Harvard University. 
                            According to this paper, a person can hold from five to nine things in their short-term memory.
                            </li>
                        <li>Mediamarkt has a large assertiment and has many familair products – even with the large assortiment, they at least tried it in a best way possible to cover them all up into the menu. </li>
                        <img src="/img/mediamarkt.jpg" class="image-content">
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>The Psychology of Mistakes</h4>
                        <li>All people make mistakes and it is defintely annoying
                            In terms of design: user testing to find out where they make a mistake.
                            </li>
                        <li>Undo button is defintely important!! after all as users we want to fix our mistakes as fast as possible. </li>
                        <li>After paying with Klarna, you will receive both a message and an email with the content of the payment and order. So if there was made a mistake you can see it in the text which is handy.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Focus, Attention and Concentration</h4>
                        <li>The attention span of an adult is from ten to twenty minutes. After this  people tend to lose focus and concentration and get distracted by anything near them</li>
                        <li>The websites need to make sure to grab the attention of the users and retain it as long as needed;</li>
                        <li>Shein has a lot of pop ups- defintely annoying if it didnt give coupons or discounts.</li>
