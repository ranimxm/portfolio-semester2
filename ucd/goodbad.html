                        <div id="biggerImg" class="biggerImg">
                            <span class="close">&times;</span>

                </figure>
                <ol>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Human interaction</h4>
                        <li>Uses colors very well: only limited to three colors (red, yellow and blue/purple) while maintaining a well composed layout. Also implementing the color theory(triadic colors);</li>
                        <li>The video on the homepage got my attention and it has a functional, responsive website.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Twitter</h4>
                         <li>Aside from being one of the most used social media, it has a very straight forward layout. If you log in through your computer you can see in the center your feed, ads and/or 
                            recommended users. On the right side you see tags, messages which you can hide and on the left side some settings and your profile. Pretty straightforward;</li>
                        <li>It is responsive, and it isn’t too difficult to understand</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Batenbouw</h4>
                        <li>The colors are being used minimalistic: not too much colors 
                            to show how serious/formal the company is. The only colors they used is blue and orange, complemtary.</li>
                        <li>The menu isn’t confusing. Instead of putting the social media or the number in the footer, they put it on the top. I don’t see it that often but it definitely is much easier if you want to contact them immediately. </li>
                        <li>Responsive and an attracting landing page. (moving images or boxes is always attracting for me. It immediately catches my eyes and feels interactive enough.)</li>
    
                    </ul>

                        <h4>Lipton Website</h4>
                        <li>The images aren’t that high of quality. You can see the white lines next to the image.</li>
                        <li>The menu doesn’t even work… If you want to close the menu, then it wont close.   </li>
                        <li>The website is responsive, aside from the menu</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Zara Shop</h4>
                        <li>The wording and placement is very confusing. What do they expect from an user? shopping? or checking out the models?</li>
                        <li>The hero page or the landing page is very confusing as well. What is the goal behind it? Do they want to make the user go to shop or want to continue looking at the beautiful changing images?</li>    
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>Cider Shop</h4>
                        <li>The font type is VERY annoying to read, and the font size is also VERY small. It is not very pleasant to read in each and every device, even on desktop. </li>
                        <li>I see what they were trying to do with their new way of managing clothing menu, however the idea backfired: it is very confusing to search for clothes. What if I only want to search for a jacket? On what am I supposed to click on? Pick a mood????</li>
                        <li>The website isn’t responsive at all.</li>
