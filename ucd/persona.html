                <h3>The persona</h3>
                <p>
                    After conducting the interviews, analysing both the survey and interview, I made a persona and an user scenario.
                    Our group decided to make one persona/user scenario for each person in our group hence why the design was presented differently while presenting.
                    When each one of us made a persona and user scenario we decided to use the most fitting persona for our group project.
                    Funny thing, I saw one of my group members using a Curriclum Vitae as a persona template. Never thought of that before, I might be using it in the future to get a better insight of my persona.

                    My persona is called Tim Simpsons. He is a student who is studying Media Design at Fontys University. From the interviews and surveys conducted with other students in various semesters, Tim's goals and frustrations align with those of the other students in the first semester who are considering Media Design.
                    Tim expressed a desire for clear information about the Media course (with the clear information about syllabus for example). I also mentioned inside the frustrations about a lack of detailed information about the course, which is a concern shared by students in the third semester who have had some experience with the course.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tim's interest and hobbies, including illustration, watching Marvel movies and playing chess also align with the interests of students in the Media course at Fontys, who expressed a sdesire for diverse and creative projects and a strong interest in media. 
                    His personality traits also match the students at Fontys who were drawn to the Media course due its creative and diverse nature.

                <h3>User Scenario</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the persona I made an user scenario. Making an user scenario is getting to know our persona better and have a better insight of the persona and motivations. I also had to think of reasons why the persona has frustrations, what the background story is etc.

                    Tim is a 23 year old student studying ICT at Fontys University. He is currently in his first semester and is considering the Media Design profile. Tim is looking for more information about the Media Design course, what he can expect from the program.
                    He wants to make sure that he is making the right chouse for his future career. He visits the Media Design website and begins browsing through the information what is provided(course structure, specializations and career opportunities).
                    As he continues to browse the website, Tim becomes frustrated with the lack of information about the course. He wishes there was more guidance and resources instead of a syllabus full of information with no pictures etc.
